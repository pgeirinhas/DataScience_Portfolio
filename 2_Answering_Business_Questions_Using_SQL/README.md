# Project 2 - Answering Business Questions Using SQL (Guided Project)

## Tools
- Database Management System to query the Database: DB Browser for SQLite version 3.12.2
- Markdown notation to explain the thought process: Python version 3 Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description
This project uses SQL skills on a record store database called Chinook. It consists of a fictional Database, through which SQL queries are used to answer possible relevant questions from the Business at a given point in time for the Chinook Management Team:
- What are the best three new albums to add to the store?
- Whose employees have the highest sale performance?
- Which countries do the store sell the most to?
- Is buying only selected single tracks from record companies more profitable for the store than buying full new albums?

**Assumptions:** All the answers assume that the Chinook Database is a Sales Sample representative of the population or that the main focus is an internal analysis. fetching music genres sales external data could be done with research and web-scrapping, however this is outside the scope of this particular project.
