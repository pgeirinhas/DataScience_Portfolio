# Project 2 - Answering Business Questions Using SQL (Guided Project)

This project uses SQL skills on a record store database.

By using the adequate queries, the following business questions are answered:

- What are the best three new albums to add to the store?
- Whose employees have the highest sale performance?
- Which countries do the store sell the most to?
- Is buying only selected single tracks from record companies more profitable for the store than buying full new albums?
