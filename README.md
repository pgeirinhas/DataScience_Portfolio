# Data Science Projects
This repository contains all the data science projects done throughout my Dataquest training.

Bear in mind these projects were completed/are being completed at different steps and that they reflect the level of knowledge at a certain point in time.

## 1 - Analysing Retailers & Salesman Performance 
### Keywords: Python Programming, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Clustering Analysis, B2B Sales 

The tobacco industry is constantly facing governmental pressure that limits traditional tobacco due to health concerns. Therefore, players need to invest in risk reduced products (e.g.: e-cigarettes, vaping products, heated tobacco, etc...) in order give consumers safer alternatives. Within their retailers channel, market players usually try to increase market share of their new products against tradional ones, by giving out money incentives for retailers' successful leads and/or sales.

For this project, I was approached from a player of the tobacco industry to act as a freelance consultant, since the client had a continuously growing dataset, but lacked resources to organize and structure meaningful analytics from the data. In particular, the client was highly concerned with the return on investment (ROI) of their money incentives campaigns for the retailers channel.    

Throughout this project Data Analysis frameworks and critical thinking are used to provide answers for the client. 
It is divided into 4 main parts:
- Designing a Python script that automates Data Acquisition; 
- Interpretation of data and definition of KPIs to inform Business Decision makers;
- Creation of a Power BI Dashboard for on-demand consultation from Sales Managers and Analyst;
- Final presentation for the client.

**Note:** the original content of the dataset was completely modified and adapted due to data privacy/ownership (with the owner's consent).

## 2 - Answering Business Questions Using SQL  
### Keywords: Data Analysis, SQL, KPIs, Music

This project uses SQL skills on a record store database.

By using the adequate queries, the following business questions are answered:

- What are the best three new albums to add to the store?
- Whose employees have the highest sale performance?
- Which countries do the store sell the most to?
- Is buying only selected single tracks from record companies more profitable for the store than buying full new albums?

## 3 - Explanatory & Exploratory Analysis For A HR Company  
### Keywords: ETL, Python, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, HR, Workforce on-demand

This project uses critical thinking and technical skills to provide analytics insights for a HR workforce on-demand company.

By using data analysis and data visualization skills on HR recruitment data, the following findings are used for decision making:
- Data Explanatory Analysis in Python (Pandas Library)
- Data Exploratory Analysis in Data Studio (Dashboard)
